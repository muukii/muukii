# My Engineering Principles

## Philosophy

I view engineering as a branch of science, aiming to create new value by combining individual technologies. In application development, this process occurs frequently. In the short term, the pursuit of quality tends to center on superficial manifestations. However, with a long-term perspective, questions of *how* to achieve goals and *how to do so efficiently* become increasingly important.

I find deep fascination in this problem-solving process. I strive to expand my thinking from concrete requirements to abstract levels and then materialize those concepts. These solutions become reusable artifacts that enable exponential improvements in development efficiency over the long term. Through this process, I continue to create new value in the world of engineering.

On the other hand, abstract solutions are not meaningless in the short term. The challenge is that creating abstract solutions takes time. However, reducing that time is one of the critical skills for an excellent engineer.

I also consider the choice between abstracting a problem or keeping it concrete to be a skill in itself. Meaningless abstraction not only creates redundancy but can also lead to inflexible and fragile artifacts.

While principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) exist, when centered on business needs, these principles cannot always be applied. Understanding how to structure code requires a deep understanding of the business direction.

Business is constantly changing. The parts we call "business logic" can sometimes benefit from being kept moderately redundant while observing how things evolve.

I believe that engineers who thrive in business are those who can select optimal approaches while balancing situations and considering trade-offs.

## The Nature of Programming

Programming is thinking, but in essence, it's the same as learning with your body.

Training your thought processes is learned physically.

For example, when you become skilled at a game, it means your operations and thought processes are organized.

At first, you think through things and devise solutions, but eventually, it becomes natural.

When asked "Why are you so good?", you would probably struggle to articulate it.

This is what we call "skill." What can be verbalized, we call a "manual."

Strategy guide == Read the "manual," practice according to it, and it becomes "skill."
